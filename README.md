- 👋 Hi, I’m @baechtel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning my way into a modicum of tech proficiency. But I'll settle for not embarrassing myself on a daily basis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to navigate github, hugo and markdown, mostly so I won't be as much of an impediment to the website magic-makers working with me on the online journal I edit: Rootstalk: A Prairie Journal of Culture, Scine and the Arts.
- 💞️ There's currently not much I’m looking to collaborate on, mostly because--at the level of "competence" I currently have--I'm really not a very worthy collaborator.
- 📫 How to reach me: at baechtel@grinndll.edu
